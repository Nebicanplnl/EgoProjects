# EgoProject

EgoProject is an Android application that manages multiple switches and dynamically updates the BottomNavigationBar based on specific rules. The app is designed to control the interaction of switches and manage the items displayed in the bottom navigation bar.

## Features

**-Ego Switch**: The default switch that is turned on when the app starts. While the Ego Switch is on, the other switches are disabled.

**-Dynamic Switch Management**: When the Ego Switch is off, other switches become active, and each switch adds an icon and label to the BottomNavigationBar as it is toggled on.

**-BottomNavigationBar**: Items are dynamically added to the BottomNavigationBar based on the order of the switches being turned on. When the Ego Switch is on, only the home icon is visible.

**-ViewBinding Usage**: ViewBinding is used to manage transitions between fragments.


**Clone the repository:**  git clone https://github.com/user/EgoProject.git



## Usage
-Upon launching the app, the Ego Switch is on by default, and only the home screen is visible in the BottomNavigationBar.

-When the Ego Switch is off, other switches become active, and each switch adds an icon to the BottomNavigationBar.

-Last Opened Switch: The last opened switch is not added to the BottomNavigationBar, and instead, a Toast message is displayed: "You cannot open this."
